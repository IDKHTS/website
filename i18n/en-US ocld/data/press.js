      `As spring arrives, various colors come into sight, making the world more lively. This is the season that your 3D prints shouldn't be dull either. So, in this contest, we invite you to make a multi-color print with your Snapmaker printers. Easter projects, gardening tools, beautiful models, etc. There are lots of things you can make out there. The rule is simple! Use more than one color in a single project, then you are good to go! You can try swapping filaments mid-printing, using a dual extruder, or simply painting your prints. Be creative and pick your way!`
      // `In this round, we encourage all users to make a special gift with Snapmaker. From 3D printed models to laser engraved ornaments and CNC carved reliefs, you name it! It's time to show your fantastic holiday gift ideas and turn your ideas into reality!`
