      comment: 'So I thought I would check out the amount of detail I could get on the laser. This is a 75 mm engraving of a Mayan calendar on a scrap piece of MDF board I had lying around.I did a vector engraving from the USB disk using the standard presets from the Snapmaker js software. It took exactly 1 hour. To say I\'m thoroughly impressed would be an understatement. I still need to work on getting things lined up and centered where they should be on the material. ',

      comment: 'The photos show a number of bespoke seat parts that I designed and printed, including a headrest for my model electric wheelchair, as part of a Proof-Of-Concept project. The seat operates with servo motors that are able to tilt the seat back and legs. The printed white hinges joining the seat sections are attached to servo motors. I could not have made this without the Snapmaker and I just love that I am able to bring my ideas to life.',

      comment: 'I got my Snapmaker today, took me about 25 minutes to assemble and another 30 minutes to calibrate and start printing. Overall, I found this to be the easiest 3D printer to assemble and use. The instruction are very easy to understand, since I am used to assemble 3D printers from China where the translation of the instructions are very difficult to understand at times. I am very happy that I purchased this printer. ',
